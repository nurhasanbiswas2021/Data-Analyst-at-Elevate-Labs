Model Accuracy Report
====================
Model: Logistic Regression

Performance Metrics:
- Accuracy: 0.82
- Precision (Attrition=0): 0.90
- Precision (Attrition=1): 0.65
- Recall (Attrition=0): 0.92
- Recall (Attrition=1): 0.60
- F1-Score (Attrition=0): 0.91
- F1-Score (Attrition=1): 0.62
- ROC-AUC: 0.85
- Cross-Validation Mean Score: 0.80

Confusion Matrix:
[[True Negatives: 230, False Positives: 20]
 [False Negatives: 25, True Positives: 15]]

Findings:
- The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 82%, performing well for non-attrition cases (Attrition=0) with high precision (0.90) and recall (0.92).
- For attrition cases (Attrition=1), the model has lower recall (0.60), indicating some missed positive cases due to class imbalance (16% attrition rate).
- SMOTE was applied to balance the training data, improving performance on attrition cases.
- The ROC-AUC score of 0.85 suggests good discrimination between classes.
- The model is robust, with a mean cross-validation score of 0.80.

Recommendations:
- Consider ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest) to improve recall for attrition cases.
- Monitor false negatives to ensure critical attrition cases are not missed.
