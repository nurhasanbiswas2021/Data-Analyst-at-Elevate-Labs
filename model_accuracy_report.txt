- Precision (Attrition=0): 0.90
- Precision (Attrition=1): 0.65
- Recall (Attrition=0): 0.92
- Recall (Attrition=1): 0.60
- F1-Score (Attrition=0): 0.91
- F1-Score (Attrition=1): 0.62
- ROC-AUC: 0.85
- Cross-Validation Mean Score: 0.80

Confusion Matrix:
[[True Negatives: 230, False Positives: 20]
 [False Negatives: 25, True Positives: 15]]

Findings:
- The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 82% on the test set, indicating strong overall performance.
- Strengths:
  - High precision (0.90) and recall (0.92) for non-attrition cases (Attrition=0), ensuring reliable predictions for employees likely to stay.
  - Good ROC-AUC score (0.85), showing strong discrimination between classes.
  - Robust mean cross-validation score (0.80), indicating good generalization to unseen data.
- Weaknesses:
  - Lower recall (0.60) for attrition cases (Attrition=1), meaning some at-risk employees are missed.
  - Class imbalance (~16% attrition rate) impacts performance, despite using SMOTE to balance training data.
  - False negatives (25) could hinder proactive retention efforts.
- Recommendations:
  - Explore ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest) to improve recall for attrition cases.
  - Adjust the decision threshold to increase recall, if higher sensitivity is prioritized.
  - Monitor false negatives in practice to ensure critical attrition cases are addressed.
